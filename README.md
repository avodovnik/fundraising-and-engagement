# Fundraising and Engagement

## Overview of Fundraising and Engagement

Fundraising and Engagement is now part of [Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/microsoft-cloud-for-nonprofit), uniquely bringing together trusted and intelligent cloud capabilities to provide nonprofits with a holistic, connected platform that unifies disparate data and empowers nonprofit workers. Please visit Microsoft Cloud for Nonprofit at [docs.microsoft](https://aka.ms/DeployMicrosoftCloudForNonprofit) for more information on how to deploy and use Fundraising and Engagement.

Fundraising and Engagement for Dynamics 365 Sales helps nonprofits modernize donor and constituent engagement to increase mission impact.

Fundraising and Engagement allows nonprofits to better understand supporters, strengthen donations and revenue management, and more precisely target and personalize communications.  A more proactive, strategic nonprofit team will identify special funding opportunities and potential major givers and increase donor loyalty and lifetime giving. By streamlining the manual work of nonprofit backoffice staff, nonprofit organizations experience greater fundraising efficiency and cost savings at a critical time where business process automation can directly translate into time spent on program and mission delivery. From faster monthly recurring gift management to data processing and imports driven by Azure, move your nonprofit staff from reactive to strategic.

In addition, eliminate the need for complex fundraising and financial reconciliation by leveraging fundraising and ERP solutions built on the Microsoft platform that leverage the Common Data Model (CDM) for Nonprofits. Get an immediate view of donations and cash flow, gain insights into fundraising efforts, and focus dollars mid-campaign where you can have the greatest results. Youâ€™ll also have a real-time view of the impact per dollar spent that you can communicate to funders at any time, so they can see the results of the programs and services their donations are funding.

Finally, Fundraising and Engagement leverages a purpose-built platform that aligns fundraising, program delivery, finance, and operations with actionable insights and impact. It will enable nonprofit organizations to integrate fundraising, finance, and program metrics to draw a clear line for grant makers and corporate partners about how each dollar drives a specific outcome. Fundraising and Engagement is part of the Dynamics 365 application platform, built on the [CDM](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/msnfp.msftnonprofitcommondatamodel?tab=Overview), so you can connect departments, applications, and systems end-to-end as your digital transformation evolves. Leverage the power of the Microsoft Cloud and your current investments with integrated, immersive experiences with Office 365 and transaction and data processing on Azure.
